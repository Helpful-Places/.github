## Helpful Places

We believe the ways places are designed and operated – and the technologies within them – should be helpful and empowering for people and their communities.

Helpful Places helps organizations, and the communities they serve, harness the power of technology in ways that are transparent, inclusive, participatory, and in alignment with community goals.
